							<h1>My First Year at RebelDot</h1>

						<p>A year ago, I walked into RebelDot for the first time as an intern — curious, slightly nervous, and very eager to learn. I had no idea that this place would end up shaping not just how I work, but how I think about technology, teamwork, and creativity.</p>

						<p>Looking back, it's hard to summarize everything that's happened since. From building AI systems and speaking at events to winning hackathons and scanning historical monuments with drones — this first year has been intense, exciting, and deeply fulfilling.</p>

						<h2>🌱 The Internship That Changed Everything</h2>

						<p>The internship was where it all started — three months of pure focus, learning, and hands-on experimentation. We weren't just following tutorials or working on throwaway exercises; we were building useful projects with actual, real-world applicability.</p>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/blog_1_year_at_rebeldot/interns_at_christmas_party.jpg" alt="Interns at Christmas Party" /></span>

						<h2>🤖 From Intern to AI Engineer</h2>

						<p>After the internship, I transitioned into a full-time AI Engineer role. That change marked the beginning of some of the most rewarding projects I've ever worked on.</p>

						<p>This year's work has focused on bridging AI reasoning with real-world use cases — systems that people actually interact with. It's one thing to build a model that performs well in a notebook, and something completely different to see a person use it in real life and benefit from it.</p>

						<p>That moment — when the first real user sent a message to something I helped build — was truly special.</p>

						<h2>🧠 Experimenting, Learning, and Building</h2>

						<p>This year I also spent a lot of time experimenting with new tools and frameworks — especially AI-assisted coding environments like Cursor. What started as curiosity turned into a series of complete, deployed websites:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong><a href="https://voic.ro" target="_blank">voic.ro</a></strong> — my own website, where I document projects like this one</li>
							<li><strong><a href="https://landgame.ro" target="_blank">landgame.ro</a></strong> — a racing simulator booking and leaderboard platform</li>
							<li><strong><a href="https://lantic.ro" target="_blank">lantic.ro</a></strong> — a brochure website for a packaging company</li>
							<li><strong>remarcdent.ro</strong> — a clean, minimal clinic site built for a client</li>
						</ul>

								<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/projects/lantic.jpg" alt="Lantic.ro Website" /></span></div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>Through these, I discovered how AI-assisted tools can dramatically speed up development while keeping full creative control. Each project was an exercise in architecture, design, and iteration — with AI as a true coding partner.</p>

						<h2>🏆 Hackathons, Challenges, and Wins</h2>

						<p>Hackathons are a big part of my journey — they're where I test ideas fast, learn new things, and meet people who love technology as much as I do.</p>

						<p>Over the last year, I've taken part in hackathons across Cluj, Bucharest, Oradea, and Budapest, and won the Embedded Challenge at iTEC Timișoara.</p>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/awards/itec2025.jpg" alt="iTEC 2025 Embedded Challenge Win" /></span>

						<p>But the biggest highlight came with <strong>OpenAI's Open Model Hackathon</strong>, where my teammate Alex Luci and I won the <strong>Best Overall Project</strong> out of <strong>8,700 participants worldwide</strong>. We built <strong>RoboChef</strong>, an AI-powered robotic assistant that turned natural language instructions into real physical actions. The experience combined everything I love — AI reasoning, robotics, and creativity.</p>

						<h2>🚀 Mentoring and Giving Back</h2>

						<p>One of the most fulfilling moments this year was being invited to mentor at <strong>NASA Space Apps Challenge Cluj-Napoca</strong>, the world's largest hackathon dedicated to space and Earth innovation.</p>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/blog_1_year_at_rebeldot/speaking_at_nasa.jpeg" alt="Speaking at NASA Space Apps Challenge" /></span>

						<p>Helping participants brainstorm, debug, and refine their ideas reminded me of how important mentorship is in tech — how much a single conversation can shift a project's direction or inspire confidence in someone just starting out.</p>

						<h2>🎤 Speaking at Noaptea Companiilor</h2>

						<p>Another memorable experience was representing RebelDot as a speaker at <strong>Noaptea Companiilor</strong>, where I had the chance to present on both nights of the event.</p>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/blog_1_year_at_rebeldot/me_at_noaptea_companiilor_night_2.jpg" alt="Speaking at Noaptea Companiilor" /></span>

						<p>On the first night, I was part of <strong>AI_talks</strong>, where we discussed Vision-Language-Action models and showcased a live demo of NVIDIA's Isaac GR00T running on a real robot — the same concept that helped us win OpenAI's hackathon.</p>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/blog_1_year_at_rebeldot/alex_at_noaptea_companiilor_night_1.jpg" alt="AI_talks at Noaptea Companiilor" /></span>

						<p>On the second night, I joined a panel discussion with RebelDot's leadership team, where we talked about the company, innovation, and emerging topics in AI like "AI-assisted coding." The discussions were open, honest, and full of great energy — the kind of conversations that make me proud to represent RebelDot.</p>

						<h2>🚁 Drone Adventures and the Sphinx</h2>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/blog_1_year_at_rebeldot/drone_project_with_dji_dock.jpeg" alt="Drone Project with DJI Dock" /></span>

						<p>Outside of RebelDot, I've continued my work in drone photogrammetry, a field I've loved for years. This year, I worked on several drone projects for industrial and creative applications, but one project stands above the rest — creating a 3D model of the Sphinx in Bucegi.</p>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/blog_1_year_at_rebeldot/sphynx_photo_3.jpeg" alt="Sphinx 3D Reconstruction" /></span>

						<p>Using drones and high-resolution imagery, I reconstructed a digital version of the monument for a Netflix documentary, where I'll even make a short appearance explaining the scanning process. Seeing that combination of technology, art, and history come together was an unforgettable experience.</p>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/blog_1_year_at_rebeldot/spyhnx_photo_1.jpeg" alt="Sphinx Monument in Bucegi" /></span>

						<p>The scanning process involved multiple flights, capturing hundreds of high-resolution images from different angles to create an accurate 3D reconstruction of this iconic landmark.</p>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/blog_1_year_at_rebeldot/sphynx_photo_2.jpeg" alt="Sphinx Photogrammetry Setup" /></span>

						<p>Working on this project reminded me why I fell in love with drones in the first place — they allow us to see and preserve the world from perspectives that were impossible just a few years ago.</p>

						<h2>📜 In the Rebel Times</h2>

						<p>Somewhere along this year's adventures, I was also featured in <strong>Rebel Times</strong>, RebelDot's internal magazine. Being included there — among so many talented colleagues — was a moment of quiet pride. It reminded me that passion doesn't go unnoticed, and that sometimes, the little things you do out of curiosity can inspire others too.</p>

						<h2>🎓 Certifications, Conferences, and Badges</h2>

						<p>This year I also completed six new certifications — four related to RebelDot projects (two AWS, one Azure, one Databricks) and two out of personal curiosity. On top of that, I attended conferences like <strong>Devtalks</strong> and participated in hackathons across the country.</p>

						<p>I've started collecting all the badges from these events — each one representing a story, a new connection, or a new lesson learned.</p>

						<h2>✨ Reflections</h2>

						<p>This first year at RebelDot has been about much more than projects and milestones. It's been about people, curiosity, and the joy of building things that matter.</p>

						<p>I've learned that consistency beats perfection, and that real growth happens when you show up, stay curious, and never stop creating. What makes this place special is how supportive everyone is — not just of the work I do at RebelDot, but also of the projects and passions I pursue outside of it. Whether it's drone photogrammetry, hackathons, or speaking at events, I've always felt encouraged to explore and grow in every direction.</p>

						<p>Most of all, I've realized that I'm lucky — because the things I do here every day are things I'd happily do even if no one paid me to. Here's to another year of exploration, innovation, and building amazing things.</p>
